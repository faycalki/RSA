# RSA Encryption and Decryption program.

This modular program provides you with the option to encrypt or decrypt files or mere strings of data using RSA encryption and decryption, also provides unicode numeral representation support for the encoded and decoded data. Furthermore, it provides full customization of the amount of digits of primes to encrypt and decrypt with, and saves your data for you if requested.

This program uses the modular functionalities of some of my other algorithms in order to make them all work together in such a way that we are able to achieve our main goal of RSA encryption and decryption at will.

## Installing / Getting started

Python Interpreter 3+ is required in order to compile the code, you may build this into an executable through other means if you wish. 
Standard compilation is all that is needed.

```shell
python RSA_Encryption_interface.py
```

Once the code is executed, follow the instructions on the screen.

## Developing

```shell
git clone https://github.com/faycalki/RSA_Encryption_and_decryption.git
```

## Features

* Efficiently encrypts and decrypts using the RSA method both files and strings
* Minimal dependencies.
* Can be implemented as a fully modular program with minimal editing, built as multiple functions.
