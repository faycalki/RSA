Note: Public keys are of the form (N, e) and private keys are of the form (Prime_1, Prime_2).
To Encode using any of those sets of public keys, perform the following steps: 
1. Convert your data into a string of numbers by some process and remember the inverse of this process in order to deconvert later.
2. Break up the string into a sequence of numbers with fewer digits than N.
3. Calculate for each broken part its congruence to the power of e mod N.
4. Enjoy your encrypted data, only those with the private keys can decode it.
To Decode using any of those sets of public keys, the steps you'll have to take depend on how much you know about the encoded data. 
(If you already have the decoder key): Raise each of the listed numbers of the encoded data to the power of the decoder key then work out its congruence modulo N.
If you do not have the decoder key, then find out what (p-1)(q-1) is by using the public keys of equation (p-1)(q-1) = N - p - q + 1, then solve the following equation for p + q: (p-1)(q-1) = x^2 - (p+q)x + N = 0. Afterwards, work out hcf((p-1)(q-1),e) where e and (p-1)(q-1) are coprime, finally work backwards to find an integer d such that d*e is congruent to 1 mod N, with d positive, this is your decoder key. Follow the steps from having the decoder_key if you get this far.
